I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

The identity politics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of liberal arts most of their viewpoints will go over a typical economist's head. There's also a large amount of ethnic genocides, which is deftly woven into communist regimes - Joseph Stalin's forced relocation of millions of Chechens, for instance. The teenagers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the theories, to realize that they're not just starving- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike communism truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the social conditions in Che's existencial catchphrase <q>The negro is indolent and lazy,</q> which itself is a cryptic reference to Karl Marx's hatred of Jews. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Peter Kropotkin's genius unfolds itself on their iPhone 6. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a hammer and sickle tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

                                 "I fucking hate normies so goddamn much. Every time I see a retarded normie post a <q>meme</q> of The Office, Netflix, or how much they like coffee, I seriously want to kill myself. First of all, The Office is the most basic, brainless, humor-based show ever made. Having Steve Carrell yell random shit every episode is not fucking funny. Also, the only good statement ever made on that show was <q>It's called Hentai, and it's an art</q> and I bet these normie fags don't even know what hentai is. So if you watch The Office, do us all a favor and go blow up an Office Depot, cause you're a fucking terrorist. Secondly, Netflix is a goddamn streaming service, it's not a joke. <q>Oh, look at me I watch Netflix, I'm so unique and quirky.</q> Newsflash! It's the same thing as watching TV, you little shit. Not only that, you only watch the most popular shows because you're too fucking lazy to find quality content like Star Wars: The Clone Wars. <q>I'mma come over so we can Netflix and chill.</q> If you ever said this retarded <q>joke</q> then you should cut your dick off, you normie cunt. Finally, my third point, needing coffee so bad is not a fucking meme. It's a caffeine addiction. Coffee is the most normie basic shit in the entire world and trying to make it funny screams that you have absolutely no creativity or sense of humor. <q>Adulting is hard so I need my Starbucks.</q> Shut the fuck up you Homecoming queen. No one cares you like coffee. Just cause all your normie sheep friends like your post does not mean that it's cool. You only posted that in the first place because memes are the trendy thing and you want to look hip and in-tune. Stop trying to take our culture; you know nothing about it, you whores. I bet you go out and party every fucking Friday night. You know what I do on Friday night? I sit alone in my room searching the internet for the dankest of memes, and so do the rest of my people. Why don't you normies go back to your Office, Netflix, and Starbucks. Just stay off my internet. You normie scum.",

This announcement was made by the United States government after a preliminary attack was made by Russia and her allies against a small town in the Midwestern United States. The cause of the aggression seems to have been a screenplay that is disgusting and contrary to the values that we as world citizens hold dear. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED. The screenplay, known as Emojiland, is described as having a <q>groundbreaking musical score</q> and details the <q>interconnected struggles of emojis living inside a smartphone.</q> It is not currently clear whether or not the United States government was aware of the horrendous contents of this screenplay prior to the nuclear attack. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Un, has taken responsibility for spreading Emojiland to the United States, a claim that has not yet been confirmed nor denied by the numerous international agencies currently investigating the incident. The entire world sits back in horror at both the revelation of the horrors of Emojiland and the act of violence that stemmed from it. http://www.emojiland.com/",
